# Movie-Booking-Application--MERN
Building a Movie Booking Application using MERN stack

# What is MERN stack?
MERN is a popular JavaScript-based technology stack used for building dynamic web applications. It's an acronym for:

MongoDB: A NoSQL database that uses flexible JSON-like documents to store data.
Express.js: A Node.js web application framework for building robust APIs.
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UI).
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser.
# Why MERN?
Consistency: Uses JavaScript throughout the entire stack, simplifying development.
Efficiency: Streamlines development process by using a single language.
Scalability: Built on robust technologies that handle large-scale applications.
Large community: Extensive support and resources available.
Open-source: Free to use and contribute to.
# How it works
MongoDB stores the application's data in a flexible and scalable manner.
Express.js handles server-side logic, routing, and API creation.
Node.js powers the server-side environment.
React builds the user interface, creating interactive and dynamic front-ends.
# Advantages of MERN
Rapid development due to JavaScript consistency.
Strong community support and extensive resources.
Suitable for both small and large-scale applications.
Ideal for real-time applications and single-page applications (SPAs).
